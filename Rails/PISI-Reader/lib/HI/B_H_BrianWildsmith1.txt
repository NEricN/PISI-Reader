Joseph was Jacob's favourite son. His father gave Joseph a coat of many
colours, to show him how much he love him.

One night Joseph had a dream. 'Listen,' he said to his brothers. 'I dreamt we were
all in the field, binding sheaves of corn. My sheaf stood upright, and all your
sheaves bowed down to it.' The next night he had another dream. 'Listen,' he said.
'I dreamt the sun and the moon and the stars all bowed down to me.' His
brothers hated him for this. 'He thinks he is better than us,' they said.
