One day Jacob sent Joseph to visit his brother who were looking after their
flocks. His brothers saw him coming. 'Here comes the dreamer,' they said.
When Joseph reached them, they ripped of his coat fo many colours. They were
just about to kill him when Reuben, the eldest, shouted, 'No, we can't murder our
own brother.' So they threw him into a pit.
