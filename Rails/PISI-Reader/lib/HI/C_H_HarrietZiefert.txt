The world is full of print. Written words are everywhere.
It's impossible to learn printed words by memorizing
them word, by word, by word. To make learning easier,
words can be grouped into families.

The words in a word family have two or more letters that
are the same. We read "ot" words and "ab" words, "it"
words and "at" words. If you know "ab," then it's easier
to learn cab, dab, and crab.

This book has words from three different word families.
All the words in a family rhyme - which means you can
add other words to the group by changing the first letter.

It's okay if some of the words you think of are not real words.
If you make "hab" or "vab" or "zab," it's not wrong - 
as long as you know the difference between a real word and
a nonsense word.

FLip each page and presto-change-o - a new word appears!
