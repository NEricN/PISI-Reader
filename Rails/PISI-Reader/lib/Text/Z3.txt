"You go, Lily," he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger--
only a Seven--wiggling with impatience in her chair. 
"I felt very angry this afternoon," Lily announced. "My Childcare 
group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, 
and they didn't obey the rules at all. One of them--a male; I don't 
know his name--kept going right to the front of the line for the slide, 
even though the rest of us were all waiting. I felt so angry at him. I 
made my hand into a fist, like this." She held up a clenched fist and 
the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture. 
"Why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?" Mother asked. 
Lily considered, and shook her head. "I don't know. They acted 
like ... like ... " 
"Animals?" Jonas suggested. He laughed. 
"That's right," Lily said, laughing too. "Like animals." Neither child 
knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to 
describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit 
in.
