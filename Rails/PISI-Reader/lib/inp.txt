"How do you expect to walk home with your loafers full of split pea soup?"
she asked George.
"Oh dear," said George. "You saw me."
"And why didn't you tell me that you hate my split pea soup?"
"I didn't want to hurt your feelings," said George.
"That's silly," said Martha. "Friends should always tell each
other the truth. As a matter of fact, I don't like split pea
soup very much myself. I only like to make it. From now on, you'll
never have to eat that awful soup again."
"What a relief!" George sighed.
"Would you like some chocolate chip cookies instead?" asked Martha.
"Oh, that would be lovely," said George.
"Then you shall have them," said his friend.
